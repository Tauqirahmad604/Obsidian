**3-tier application Architecture:**

- A 3-tier architecture is a software design pattern that separates an application into three distinct layers: the presentation layer, the application layer, and the data layer. The presentation layer handles the user interface and user interactions. The application layer contains the business logic that processes data and makes decisions. The data layer manages data storage and retrieval, typically involving a database.

**Enhancing Deployment Efficiency**:

- In our proposal, we outline a modern architecture leveraging two Virtual Machines (VMs) to optimize the deployment and management of application. One VM will host the backend application, securely connected to a database for efficient data management. The other VM will house a Dockerized frontend, ensuring flexible deployment and scalability.
- This architecture allows for horizontal scaling of the frontend and backend independently to handle varying loads effectively.
- Implementing load balancing and redundancy strategies to ensure continuous availability and minimal downtime.
- Designing the architecture with future growth in mind, allowing for easy integration of new features and technologies as the application evolves.
