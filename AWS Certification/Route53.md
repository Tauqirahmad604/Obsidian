### 1. Simple Routing Policy

Routes traffic to a single resource (like one server or IP). Used when you have only one endpoint.

---

### 2. Weighted Routing Policy

Distributes traffic across multiple resources based on set weights (e.g., 70% to server A, 30% to server B).

---

### 3. Latency-based Routing Policy

Routes users to the region that provides the lowest latency (fastest response time) based on their location.

---

### 4. Failover Routing Policy

Routes traffic to a primary resource and switches to a backup if the primary becomes unhealthy.

---

### 5. Geolocation Routing Policy

Routes traffic based on the geographic location of the user (e.g., users in the US go to a US server).

---

### 6. Geoproximity Routing Policy

Routes traffic based on the userâ€™s proximity to a resource and can shift traffic using a bias value (requires Traffic Flow).

---

### 7. Multi-value Answer Routing Policy

Returns multiple healthy records to the user, acting like basic DNS-based load balancing.
