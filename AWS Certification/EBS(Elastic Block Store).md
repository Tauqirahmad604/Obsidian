### EBS Snapshot Features

**Incremental Snapshots**: Archiving stores a **full copy** of the snapshot, even if the original snapshot was incremental. This makes the archived version much larger.

- Example: Incremental snapshots may occupy only 10 GB in the standard tier, but archiving them could result in a full 100 GB snapshot being stored, leading to higher costs.
