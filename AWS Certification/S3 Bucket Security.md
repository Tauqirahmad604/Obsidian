- AWS KMS has limits on the number of requests you can make per second, which could be a concern for high-throughput workloads. The default limits are:
    - **5,000 requests per second** for encryption and decryption operations.
    - **100 requests per second** for other operations like creating or disabling keys.
- You can request an increase in these limits, but it may not always be suitable for extremely high-volume applications.
