- AWS KMS has limits on the number of requests you can make per second, which could be a concern for high-throughput workloads. The default limits are:
    - **5,000 requests per second** for encryption and decryption operations.
    - **100 requests per second** for other operations like creating or disabling keys.
- You can request an increase in these limits, but it may not always be suitable for extremely high-volume applications.

### What is CORS?

**CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent websites from making requests to a different domain (or origin) than the one the page was loaded from.

For example, if your website (`www.mywebsite.com`) tries to fetch data from a different website (like `www.s3bucket.com`), the browser might block this request to protect user data.

However, sometimes you **want** your website to interact with data from another domain (like fetching an image from Amazon S3). That's where **CORS** comes in! It lets you control which websites are allowed to access your data.

### Why Use CORS in S3?

When you store data in **Amazon S3** (like images, videos, or files), and you want to let other websites or applications access this data, you need to configure **CORS** in S3 to allow them to do that.

For example, if you have a **website hosted at `www.mywebsite.com`** and your images are stored in **S3**, you need CORS to allow `www.mywebsite.com` to access those images.

**Amazon S3 Glacier Lock** is a feature that allows you to **lock your data** in Amazon S3 Glacier Vaults using a **"write-once-read-many" (WORM)** model. This ensures that data cannot be **deleted** or **modified** for a specified period of time, which is useful for regulatory compliance, data retention, and archiving purposes.

## **Governance Mode**

- **Description**: Governance Mode allows you to protect objects from being deleted or modified, but authorized users (with special permissions) can **bypass** the lock to delete or update the objects if needed.


## **Compliance Mode**

- **Description**: Compliance Mode is **strict** and ensures that no one, including the **root user** or AWS administrators, can modify or delete an object until the retention period expires.

1. Create a policy in which define that bucket can be accessable only from the access points.
2. Create access point and give the users arn to which you wants to give permissions and write which actions those users can perform throught the access point like put, get etc.

An **AWS S3 Access Point** is a **customized endpoint** that you can create to **manage access** to an S3 bucket in a **more controlled and scalable way**. Instead of directly using a bucket name, you create **multiple access points** with unique policies to control how different applications or teams access the same bucket.
