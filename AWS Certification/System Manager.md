Without Systems Manager:

- You SSH into each EC2 instance one by one to update a package.
    
With Systems Manager (at scale):

- You send a command via SSM **once**, and it runs on **all 500 EC2 instances** automatically.




### **What You Can Manage with AWS Systems Manager:**

| Resource Type           | Can Be Managed? | Notes                                                     |

| **Edge devices / IoT**  | âœ… Yes           | As long as they support SSM agent and have connectivity   |
| **ECS containers**      | ðŸŸ¡ Partially    | Some integration possible via tasks and parameter store   |
