### **a. Full SSL (End-to-End Encryption)**

**What it is:**

- In Full SSL, the data is encrypted all the way from the client (e.g., a browser or API client) to the destination server (e.g., a web server or backend application).
- 
- This ensures that the data remains private and secure throughout its journey.

**How it works:**

1. The client sends encrypted requests using HTTPS.
2. A certificate installed on the destination server (or backend) encrypts the data.
3. The server decrypts the data, processes it, and responds to the client with encrypted data.

**Use Cases:**

- Ideal for scenarios requiring high security:
    - E-commerce websites.
    - Banking and payment systems.
    - APIs with sensitive data.



### **b. SSL Termination** (SSL offloading)

**What it is:**

- In SSL Termination, the encrypted connection ends at an intermediary (like a load balancer or reverse proxy), which decrypts the data before forwarding it to backend servers.

**How it works:**

1. The client sends an encrypted HTTPS request.
2. The load balancer (or proxy) decrypts the request using its SSL certificate.
3. The decrypted data is then forwarded to the backend server as plain HTTP.

**Use Cases:**

- Common in setups with load balancers like:
    - **AWS ALB** (Application Load Balancer).
    - **NGINX** or **Traefik** acting as reverse proxies.
- Suitable when backend servers lack SSL support or when SSL processing is computationally expensive.


### **c. SSL Passthrough**

**What it is:**

- In SSL Passthrough, the encrypted traffic from the client is forwarded as-is to the backend server without being decrypted at any intermediate point.

**How it works:**

1. The client sends an encrypted HTTPS request.
2. The load balancer passes this encrypted data directly to the backend server.
3. The backend server decrypts the data using its SSL certificate.

**Use Cases:**

- Useful when:
    - Backend servers need to see client certificates for authentication.
    - Security policies mandate end-to-end encryption.
    - Load balancers or proxies are not required to inspect or modify the traffic.
