**EC2 Hibernation** is a feature in AWS that allows you to **pause** an EC2 instance and **resume it later** without losing the data in memory (RAM). When you hibernate an EC2 instance, AWS saves the contents of the instance's memory (RAM) to **Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)** and then stops the instance. When you resume the instance, it is restored to its previous state, including the applications and data in memory.
