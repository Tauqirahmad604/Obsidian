### What is an **inode** in Linux?

An **inode** (short for **index node**) is a fundamental data structure used by Linux and Unix-like file systems to **store metadata about a file**.

### ðŸ§  In Simple Terms:

An **inode** is like a fileâ€™s identity card.  
It doesn't store the file's **name** or **actual data**, but it stores everything **about** the file.
